<p>Fusion, transcendence: it's what he's always done. At 74, Carlos Santana is still as curious as ever, and his 26th studio album brings together all his current interests, with an unabashedly popularising aim. With this record, the Mexican-born guitarist wanted to "return to radio". And this album has all the ingredients to make its mark on the airwaves in the coming months. First of all, he relaunched his duet with Rob Thomas, which had won a Grammy for <em>Smooth</em> at the time of <em>Supernatural</em>, Santana's 1999 comeback album. And the very groovy track <em>Move</em> looks set to do it again. The cover of Manu Dibango's <em>Soul Fiesta</em> (taken from 1972’s <em>Africadelic</em>), here becomes <em>Santana Celebration,</em> an intro in the form of a percussion and wah-wah jam, is also a noteworthy track.<br /><br />Santana then wanders between Latin music <em>(Rumbalero</em> with Asdru Sierra from the Californian band Ozomatli), pop passages <em>(Break</em>, <em>Breathing Underwater</em>, <em>She's Fire</em>) and high-quality guest appearances, starting with <em>Joy</em>, with country singer Chris Stapleton coming in for a well-oiled reggae/blues double-act, and a cover of Procol Harum's <em>Whiter Shade of Pale</em> featuring Steve Winwood. But the highlight of the album is the encounter with Kirk Hammett, the guitarist of Metallica (+ Mark Osegueda, the singer in Death Angels) on<em> America for</em> Sale, six minutes of rage with a totally unbridled finale featuring these two guitar heroes. Note also that <em>Blessings & Miracles</em> contains Chick Corea's very final recording, on <em>Angel Choir / All Together</em>. The legendary American pianist, who died in February 2021, had sent over a keyboard part, which Santana embellished with his guitar, creating an excellent jazz-rock track, rounded out by the musician’s widow, Gayle Moran Corea, who provided the opening chorus. © Smaël Bouaici/Qobuz</p>
